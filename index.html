    <p>Elissa Ruckle has been working in the employee development field for over twenty years, fifteen of those here in Wyoming.  She has extensive experience as a curriculum designer, program facilitator, and project leader.  In her current role as owner of Elevate Wyoming, she gets to wear all those hats (and a few more).  Elissa is dedicated to helping others succeed and passionate about the importance of personal relationships - how they affect the workplace and business cultures and how they shape our community as a whole.  A native of Wyoming and graduate of UW (#GoPokes), she’s excited to have a son graduating from Laramie and a daughter who plans to attend after high school.  When not working, you can find her exploring new places with her family, backpacking in the mountains of Wyoming, playing in the dirt of her gardens, or enjoying coffee and conversation with others.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
    <p>Kyle has a background in psychology and behavioral health, giving him insight into how people think and how programs can successfully engage their participants. The author Daniel Pink argues that “there is a difference between what science knows and what business does” and Kyle has made it part of his personal mission to help bridge that gap. A lifetime of building genuine relationships within his community has forged in him a deep passion to make Wyoming an even better place to live and work. He may not have traveled enough yet to support the claim that it’s the BEST place in the world to settle down…but he’s pretty sure it’s near the top.  He finds happiness in many things, but first and foremost is his family, his wife, and their one-year-old daughter. What keeps them here is the powerful sense of community and the amazing access to natural resources, especially mountains and rivers.</p>

    <p>Laurie Davis brings order out of chaos.  With over twenty years in administrative roles in HR, healthcare, and energy, Laurie combines broad expertise with a genuinely friendly and helpful personal style.  She flows seamlessly from writing policies and coordinating event logistics to designing marketing campaigns and joining in collaborative team meetings.  After being born and raised in Wyoming, she ventured to Denver but came back home because she savors the size of our community and our ability to have a genuine positive impact in it.  She loves hanging out with her family and watching her grand baby learn and grow. When at her most peaceful, you’ll find Laurie doing early morning yoga before her husband and dogs have even gotten out of bed. </p>

    <p>Luke Gilliam genuinely wants to help people and make a difference in our community.  His passion for leadership has influenced every job he’s had, activity in which he’s participated, and even the major he chose in college.  Positions in athletics, education, and finance have shown him that many people hunger for good programs to help them do their jobs better, set themselves up for future opportunities, and go home happy while on that journey.  Given these interests, you might not be surprised to hear he’s a lifelong learner about personal leadership, talent development, and team performance.  Having lived in Colorado and Texas, he feels blessed to have married a Wyoming native and to live in a place that feels like home.  When not reading, listening to a podcast, writing his own book, watching The Office or Seinfeld with his wife…you might find Luke celebrating the newest trick learned by their puppy Cosmo.  </p>

                  <h2>Jonah Bank</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Casper, WY</p>
                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="images/Testimonials/JonahModal.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Just like any small business, we started our bank from scratch.  During the first five years we each wore many hats, focusing our time on building our business.  Many years later, the bank was doing well and our roles shifted more towards leadership and staff development, rather than the daily operations of the bank.  This posed a new dilemma...we were good bankers, but could we develop a large group, that seemed to exponentially grow overnight, into “Jonah Bankers.”  All business owners recognize the challenge; “How do we recreate the passion with the folks who weren’t here when we were born?”  Truth is, we know banking; we specialize in numbers and relationships with customers.  We don’t have degrees in psychology, nor is this an area we can afford to hire someone full time to handle.  It needed to be OUR RESPONSIBILITY and it was as important as any other of our business components.  You hear it all the time, human capital is the key. Our solution?  Elevate Wyoming!
                    <br><br>
                    Elissa and the Elevate Team helped us define our expectations, identify our priorities and get to work!  After our first year I can proudly say, Jonah Bank Managers are focused on developing new and great Jonah Bankers!  We are by no means done, but we have a path and we have amazing partners to help us navigate that path.  Elevate has become a part of our Jonah family and we benefit daily from their contributions.

                  <h2>Community Health Center of Central Wyoming</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Casper, WY</p>
                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="images/Testimonials/CHCCWModal.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Prior to teaming up with Elevate Wyoming, CHCCW tried to craft a number of strategic plans over its 16-year history but had very little success getting something completed that was both meaningful and useful. As a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), the Community Health Center of Central Wyoming (CHCCW) has over 110 employees and serves 14,000 people for their primary medical, behavioral and dental care needs across Central Wyoming. Part of the organizations responsibility as an FQHC is to reduce barriers to care while fulfilling its mission to both its patients and employees and it was important that we had a strategic plan that could do both.
                    <br><br>
                    As a Federally funded program, CHCCW must be fiscally sound and a good steward of the Federal dollars provided to assist in care delivery; having a good strategic plan was going to be important in the coming years as CHCCW faced declining reimbursement from insurance companies, increased competition in our service areas, and unfunded mandates from State and Federal agencies. Elevate’s contact information was provided by the Casper Chamber of Commerce as an organization that has a strong track record in assisting organizations like CHCCW in developing and implementing strategic plans.
                    <br><br>
                    Elevate Wyoming took a very team-based approach when they engaged CHCCW during our planning and implementation process. The entire planning and development process took about three months to complete and Elevate Wyoming was there every step of the way. In addition to working with leadership and management, they engaged our Board of Directors and frontline staff to provide input and gain a better perspective of the organization, our needs and the direction CHCCW needed to go. Employee surveys and workshops provided an invaluable experience to the entire organization as first-hand knowledge was gained that helped develop a strategic plan that was well organized and contained achievable goals the organization and its employees could get behind.
                    <br><br>
                    After the planning process, Elevate Wyoming assisted CHCCW in finalizing the draft of the strategic plan and then worked with leadership, management and staff over the coming months to communicate and operationalize the plan. Too often strategic plans are made and go into a binder and put on a shelf where they collect dust. The strategic plan that Elevate helped CHCCW build is a living, breathing plan that is designed to be used daily and updated as needed. Without their help on this project CHCCW’s plan would have been very one dimensional and lacked effectiveness. Fast-forward 18 months later and CHCCW has met most of the goals laid out in that plan and have continued to use the process and techniques delivered by Elevate.

                    As a community behavioral health center, Central Wyoming Counseling Center is dedicated to helping the members of our community achieve their treatment goals.  This endeavor involves our entire staff: from the folks in Finance to our Kitchen staff, from the Customer Service Reps to IT, from our Residential Specialists to our Nurses and Clinicians.  If we are not careful the daily whirlwind of unexpected and unplanned events can divert our focus from investing energy into the strategic goals that help us provide high quality services.  Through a series of talks, trainings, and workshops, Elevate has equipped our management team with the skills to help all our employees stay connected to our mission.  The management team wins, the employees win, and most importantly our clients win. They helped us turn the whirlwind into a whirl-win.

                    Successful partnerships are the back bone of our community and the Chamber.  We are honored to have Elevate Wyoming as one of key partners.
                    <br><br>
                    The Casper Area Chamber of Commerce is profoundly grateful for the facilitation of our Leadership Casper Program, through the exceptional talent and skills of our member partner Elissa Ruckle, master facilitator and owner of Elevate Wyoming.  Elissa guides the class in a variety of leadership topics based on their areas of interest and growth opportunities.  She is exceptional in customizing her programs annually to fit the needs of class members, their businesses and the ever-changing demands of our economy and workforce. Elevate Wyoming has a wealth of experience in a variety of different areas that make our Leadership Casper Program a highly coveted opportunity for local businesses to invest in their greatest assets…their people.
                    <br><br>
                    Elissa has also been instrumental in the development and successful implementation of our Junior Leadership Summer Camp, a leadership program for incoming 8th and 9th grade students now entering its third season. This program works to increase self-awareness and self-confidence, develop a sense of concern for the welfare of others, and to challenge students to participate in school and community service. This year Elissa has designed content to focus on Being Your Best Self, Giving of Yourself, Leading with Your Heart, and Being an Agent of Change.
                    <br><br>
                    Elevate Wyoming also provides professional development workshops to each and every Chamber member business as a benefit of their membership.  Our members place a high value on the topics of choice that help them grow and develop their businesses.
