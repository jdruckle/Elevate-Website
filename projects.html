              <h3>Jonah Bank</h3>
              <p>Jonah Bank of Wyoming is a local bank that is deeply committed to its local communities.  Early adopters of the Code of the West, they also believe that culture is a critical aspect of their bank’s success.  Having grown radically and expanded to four branches, they wanted to be as talented at developing people as they are in the world of finance.  We helped them create a Legacy Leadership program that honored the Jonah Bank Code and tied it to daily behaviors.  This program was initially delivered to managers and has expanded to all employees.</p>

              <p>Community Health Centers of Central Wyoming believes in providing quality, affordable healthcare to the community.  Creating the best possible experience for patients means doing the same for its employees.  They wanted to mobilize their senior leaders and mobilize their people to return to their mission.  We worked with them to determine where their employees were and how they could better engage them.  Through a collaborative process, we crafted a strategic plan that was more than a one-time creation.  Monthly sessions celebrate the regular progress they’re making towards that plan’s goals and also devote resources to further developing their senior leadership team.</p>

              <p>Wind City Physical Therapy has locations across the State and believes it’s possible to truly serve patients and run a healthy human-centered business.  They wanted to reinforce their front-line employees’ value to the organization and enlist them in creating the best possible experience for their patients.  We helped them build an interactive series of development sessions, so front-line staff could provide quality patient care and run day-to-day operations more efficiently. We then worked with their clinic Directors to refine some of their management systems and processes. As they continue to grow, we’ll continue to work with the owners to ensure that growth stays in line with their enduring vision.</p>

              <p>The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has tremendous pride and confidence in the agency's culture and believes that developing employees’ leadership skills will make their culture, commitment, and performance even stronger, more sustainable.  They believe that building individual, managerial, and organizational leadership skills will help them perform individual duties better, communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, and forge a better future for us all. We helped them determine needs across the department, design a hands-on curriculum employees will embrace, and develop highly interactive two-day sessions held in various locations around the State.  The result is a tiered Leadership Development program that focuses on personal leadership the first-year and a second-year program designed for people in informal and formal leadership roles.</p>
