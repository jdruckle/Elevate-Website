                  <h2>Jonah Bank</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Casper, WY</p>
                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="images/Testimonials/JonahModal.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Just like any small business, we started our bank from scratch.  During the first five years we each wore many hats, focusing our time on building our business.  Many years later, the bank was doing well and our roles shifted more towards leadership and staff development, rather than the daily operations of the bank.  This posed a new dilemma...we were good bankers, but could we develop a large group, that seemed to exponentially grow overnight, into “Jonah Bankers.”  All business owners recognize the challenge; “How do we recreate the passion with the folks who weren’t here when we were born?”  Truth is, we know banking; we specialize in numbers and relationships with customers.  We don’t have degrees in psychology, nor is this an area we can afford to hire someone full time to handle.  It needed to be OUR RESPONSIBILITY and it was as important as any other of our business components.  You hear it all the time, human capital is the key. Our solution?  Elevate Wyoming!
                    <br><br>
                    Elissa and the Elevate Team helped us define our expectations, identify our priorities and get to work!  After our first year I can proudly say, Jonah Bank Managers are focused on developing new and great Jonah Bankers!  We are by no means done, but we have a path and we have amazing partners to help us navigate that path.  Elevate has become a part of our Jonah family and we benefit daily from their contributions.

                  <h2>Community Health Center of Central Wyoming</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Casper, WY</p>
                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="images/Testimonials/CHCCWModal.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>
                    Prior to teaming up with Elevate Wyoming, CHCCW tried to craft a number of strategic plans over its 16-year history but had very little success getting something completed that was both meaningful and useful. As a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), the Community Health Center of Central Wyoming (CHCCW) has over 110 employees and serves 14,000 people for their primary medical, behavioral and dental care needs across Central Wyoming. Part of the organizations responsibility as an FQHC is to reduce barriers to care while fulfilling its mission to both its patients and employees and it was important that we had a strategic plan that could do both.
                    <br><br>
                    As a Federally funded program, CHCCW must be fiscally sound and a good steward of the Federal dollars provided to assist in care delivery; having a good strategic plan was going to be important in the coming years as CHCCW faced declining reimbursement from insurance companies, increased competition in our service areas, and unfunded mandates from State and Federal agencies. Elevate’s contact information was provided by the Casper Chamber of Commerce as an organization that has a strong track record in assisting organizations like CHCCW in developing and implementing strategic plans.
                    <br><br>
                    Elevate Wyoming took a very team-based approach when they engaged CHCCW during our planning and implementation process. The entire planning and development process took about three months to complete and Elevate Wyoming was there every step of the way. In addition to working with leadership and management, they engaged our Board of Directors and frontline staff to provide input and gain a better perspective of the organization, our needs and the direction CHCCW needed to go. Employee surveys and workshops provided an invaluable experience to the entire organization as first-hand knowledge was gained that helped develop a strategic plan that was well organized and contained achievable goals the organization and its employees could get behind.
                    <br><br>
                    After the planning process, Elevate Wyoming assisted CHCCW in finalizing the draft of the strategic plan and then worked with leadership, management and staff over the coming months to communicate and operationalize the plan. Too often strategic plans are made and go into a binder and put on a shelf where they collect dust. The strategic plan that Elevate helped CHCCW build is a living, breathing plan that is designed to be used daily and updated as needed. Without their help on this project CHCCW’s plan would have been very one dimensional and lacked effectiveness. Fast-forward 18 months later and CHCCW has met most of the goals laid out in that plan and have continued to use the process and techniques delivered by Elevate.

                    As a community behavioral health center, Central Wyoming Counseling Center is dedicated to helping the members of our community achieve their treatment goals.  This endeavor involves our entire staff: from the folks in Finance to our Kitchen staff, from the Customer Service Reps to IT, from our Residential Specialists to our Nurses and Clinicians.  If we are not careful the daily whirlwind of unexpected and unplanned events can divert our focus from investing energy into the strategic goals that help us provide high quality services.  Through a series of talks, trainings, and workshops, Elevate has equipped our management team with the skills to help all our employees stay connected to our mission.  The management team wins, the employees win, and most importantly our clients win. They helped us turn the whirlwind into a whirl-win.

                    Successful partnerships are the back bone of our community and the Chamber.  We are honored to have Elevate Wyoming as one of key partners.
                    <br><br>
                    The Casper Area Chamber of Commerce is profoundly grateful for the facilitation of our Leadership Casper Program, through the exceptional talent and skills of our member partner Elissa Ruckle, master facilitator and owner of Elevate Wyoming.  Elissa guides the class in a variety of leadership topics based on their areas of interest and growth opportunities.  She is exceptional in customizing her programs annually to fit the needs of class members, their businesses and the ever-changing demands of our economy and workforce. Elevate Wyoming has a wealth of experience in a variety of different areas that make our Leadership Casper Program a highly coveted opportunity for local businesses to invest in their greatest assets…their people.
                    <br><br>
                    Elissa has also been instrumental in the development and successful implementation of our Junior Leadership Summer Camp, a leadership program for incoming 8th and 9th grade students now entering its third season. This program works to increase self-awareness and self-confidence, develop a sense of concern for the welfare of others, and to challenge students to participate in school and community service. This year Elissa has designed content to focus on Being Your Best Self, Giving of Yourself, Leading with Your Heart, and Being an Agent of Change.
                    <br><br>
                    Elevate Wyoming also provides professional development workshops to each and every Chamber member business as a benefit of their membership.  Our members place a high value on the topics of choice that help them grow and develop their businesses.
